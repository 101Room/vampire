Vampire uses the following main branches:

(maint): - updates for previous release
master: - current release in progress
new: - completed features for inclusion in release after next

new is a superset of master is a superset of maint. NEVER merge from maint to master or master to new!

New ideas should be developed in a dedicated branch forked from master.
 
git checkout -b new_feature_name
git push origin new_feature_name

Once completed and tested this can be merged with new and staged for later inclusion with master. 

(on branch master"git merge new_feature")

At this point the initial development branch should be deleted.
