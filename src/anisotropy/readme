//                      VAMPIRE anisotropy module
//------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This module implements various forms of magnetic anisotropy within the
VAMPIRE code, including uniaxial, cubic, surface and temperature dependent
lattice anisotropy. For high performance all anisotropies are rolled into three
tensors, of order 2, 4 and 6 representing the different orders of magnetic
anisotropy. A tensor of each order is stored for each individual atom which
greatly simplifies the code structure and calculation to a simple
vector-matrix-vector multiplication such as

( Sx Sy Sz ) ( Txx Txy Txz ) ( Sx )
             ( Tyx Tyy Tyz ) ( Sy )
             ( Tzx Tzy Tzz ) ( Sz )

for a second order anisotropy. The tensor form is computed once at the beginning
 of the simulation and incorporates the correct components for different
 materials and symmetries.

Uniaxial anisotropy is implemented with spherical harmonics with even LeGrandre
polynomials. Cubic anisotropy is implemented as directional cosines. Surface
anisotropy expands the local components to an onsite anisotropy which is
time invariant.
