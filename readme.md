Vampire
==============

By Richard Evans

Vampire is a high performance general purpose code for the atomistic simulation of magnetic materials. Using a variety of common simulation methods it can calculate the equilibrium and dynamic magnetic properties of a wide variety of magnetic materials and phenomena, including ferro, ferri and antiferromagnets, core-shell nanoparticles, ultrafast spin dynamics, magnetic recording media, heat assisted magnetic recording, exchange bias, magnetic multilayer films and complete devices.

Capabilities
---------------
Vampire is designed to be highly flexible to deal with a wide variety of problems using a diverse set of simulation tools and methods. The capabilities of the code can be summarised broadly in terms of the simulation methods, standard problems, structural properties and features of the code, all of which can be combined to tackle almost any problem.
